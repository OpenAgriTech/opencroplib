OpenCropLib
==============

Python Library for simulating physiological processes in plants.
The aim of this project is to implement the energy balance model
developed in Berni et al. 2009 that allows to estimate canopy conductance
from a combination of canopy temperature and basic micro-metheorological
observations.

The different components of the model can also be used in the simulation and
estimation of physical processes such as aerodynamic modeling, calculation
of solar radiation, etc.
